# Anchor Projects

This repository contains a collection of Anchor-based projects on Solana blockchain. Each project is an implementation of different concepts in the Solana ecosystem, using the Anchor framework for building Solana smart contracts. These projects demonstrate the use of Solana‚Äôs powerful decentralized network and the Anchor framework for efficient and secure contract development.

## Projects

### 1. [vault-anchor](./vault-anchor)
**Status:** Completed üöÄ  
**Description:**  
The `vault-anchor` project is a simple vault contract built using the Anchor framework. It allows users to deposit and withdraw tokens securely. The contract handles basic logic such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance management.  
- **Technology Stack:**
  - **Anchor:** Solana smart contract framework
  - **Solana CLI:** For deployment and interaction
  - **Rust:** For backend programming of the vault contract
  - **Testing:** Mocha & Chai for unit tests

- **Features:**
  - Deposit SOL into the vault.
  - Withdraw SOL from the vault.
  - Track balance of the vault.
  - Testable with unit tests using Mocha.

## Project Structure
This command creates a multi-program Anchor workspace (snap-ledger) with built-in support for error handling, **state** and **instruction management**, and **testing‚Äîideal** for building complex dApps with multiple smart contracts.

```bash 
anchor init snap-ledger --template multiple
```

### 1 Account Structure 
These define data storage on Solana.
- ``` merchant.rs ``` Defines the Merchant struct that holds data related to the merchant, like name, wallet address, total sales, etc.

``` bash
 #[account]
 pub struct Merchant {
    pub merchant: Pubkey,    
    pub authority: Pubkey,  
    pub name: String,        
    pub category: String,     
}  

```

- ``` customer.rs ``` Defines the Customer struct which stores customer-related information such as wallet, balance, or past purchases.


``` bash

#[account]
pub struct Customer{
    pub customer: Pubkey,     
    pub name: String,         
    pub phone: String,        
    pub authority: Pubkey,   
}


```

- ``` receipt.rs ``` Defines the Receipt struct to store transaction details between customer and merchant ‚Äî like bill amount, timestamp, and payment status.


``` bash
#[account]
pub struct Receipt {
    pub customer: Pubkey,      
    pub merchant: Pubkey,     
    pub item_name: String,          
    pub item_description: String,  
    pub item_price: f64,            
}
```

### 2 Instructions
These handle transactions and interactions with the smart contract.

- ``` initialize_merchant.rs ``` Initializes a merchant account with a unique PDA for secure identification.
``` bash
  #[account(
        init,
        seeds = [b"merchant", authority.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
        payer = authority,
        space = Merchant::INIT_SPACE
    )]
    pub merchant_account: Account<'info, Merchant>,

```

- ``` initialize_customer.rs ``` Initializes a customer account with a unique PDA for secure identification.
``` bash
 #[account(
        init,
        seeds = [b"customer", merchant.key().as_ref(), customer.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
        payer = authority,
        space = Customer::INIT_SPACE
    )]
    pub customer_account: Account<'info, Customer>, 

```


- ``` initialize_receipt.rs ``` Initializes a receipt account with a unique PDA for secure identification.

``` bash
    #[account(
        init,
        seeds = [b"receipt", merchant.key().as_ref(), customer.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
        payer = authority,
        space = Receipt::INIT_SPACE
    )]
    pub receipt: Account<'info, Receipt>,
```
- ``` pay_bill.rs ``` instruction likely handles the bill payment process.
