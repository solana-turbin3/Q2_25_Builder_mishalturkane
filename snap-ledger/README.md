## Project Structure
This command creates a multi-program Anchor workspace (snap-ledger) with built-in support for error handling, **state** and **instruction management**, and **testing‚Äîideal** for building complex dApps with multiple smart contracts.

```bash 
anchor init snap-ledger --template multiple
```

### 1 Account Structure 
These define data storage on Solana.
- ``` merchant.rs ``` Defines the Merchant struct that holds data related to the merchant, like name, wallet address, total sales, etc.

``` bash
 #[account]
 pub struct Merchant {
    pub merchant: Pubkey,    
    pub authority: Pubkey,  
    pub name: String,        
    pub category: String,     
}  

```

- ``` customer.rs ``` Defines the Customer struct which stores customer-related information such as wallet, balance, or past purchases.


``` bash

#[account]
pub struct Customer{
    pub customer: Pubkey,     
    pub name: String,         
    pub phone: String,        
    pub authority: Pubkey,   
}


```

- ``` receipt.rs ``` Defines the Receipt struct to store transaction details between customer and merchant ‚Äî like bill amount, timestamp, and payment status.


``` bash
#[account]
pub struct Receipt {
    pub customer: Pubkey,      
    pub merchant: Pubkey,     
    pub item_name: String,          
    pub item_description: String,  
    pub item_price: f64,            
}
```

### 2 Instructions
These handle transactions and interactions with the smart contract.

- ``` initialize_merchant.rs ``` Initializes a merchant account with a unique PDA for secure identification.
``` bash
  #[account(
        init,
        seeds = [b"merchant", authority.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
        payer = authority,
        space = Merchant::INIT_SPACE
    )]
    pub merchant_account: Account<'info, Merchant>,

```

- ``` initialize_customer.rs ``` Initializes a customer account with a unique PDA for secure identification.
``` bash
 #[account(
        init,
        seeds = [b"customer", merchant.key().as_ref(), customer.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
        payer = authority,
        space = Customer::INIT_SPACE
    )]
    pub customer_account: Account<'info, Customer>, 

```


- ``` initialize_receipt.rs ``` Initializes a receipt account with a unique PDA for secure identification.

``` bash
    #[account(
        init,
        seeds = [b"receipt", merchant.key().as_ref(), customer.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
        payer = authority,
        space = Receipt::INIT_SPACE
    )]
    pub receipt: Account<'info, Receipt>,
```
- ``` pay_bill.rs ``` instruction likely handles the bill payment process.
